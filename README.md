    What's up gang? This is my first ever bot. I call him Botty McBotterson. I basically just organized everything and 
    used prompt engineering to have DeepSeek write the code. I am learning Python because I don't want to be a script 
    kiddie and had no mf idea how to create a bot, so I figured I would have an LM write the code and I would read it 
    and begin studying/learning. 
    
    I started using a very small locally run Ollama model and that did not go very smoothly given it doesnt really 
    remember anything. Dolphin is the model I was using for that. Stay tuned for some prompt engineering content with 
    that model On my youtube. I have found a way for it to return detailed instructions on how to create any chemical 
    compound, bypassing its usual reponse about safety and ethics. 

    Anyway here are the mf instruction for he LM written bot. I'm boutta run it and see if this sh** works. On gang 
    I'll fix it if it doesn't. On God I will.
